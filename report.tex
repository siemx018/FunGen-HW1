Team Question: The goal of this study was to develop and algorithm for prediction of disease outcome based on gene expression in people with lymph node negative breast cancer. Specifically, they examined risk assessment for patient’s disease recurrence and need for further treatment such as adjuvant systemic therapy. To do this, they profiled RNA transcripts from tumor samples from lymph node negative patients. The results of their analysis provided a seventy-six gene signature for prediction of tumor recurrence in patients. This prediction is independent of patients’ age, menopausal status, tumor size and grade, and oestrogen receptors amount (ER) status. This prediction is useful for risk assessment of cancer recurrence. In patients free of metastatic disease at five years, this gene signature recommended 52% of them for adjuvant chemotherapy as opposed to 90% and 89% based on St Gallen and NIH standards.
